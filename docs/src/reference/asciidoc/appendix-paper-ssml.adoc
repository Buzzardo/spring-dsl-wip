== Spring Statemachine
This appendix provides a paper how _Spring Statemachine Markup Language_ were created.

As _Spring Dsl_ were originally created from an idea of providing a generic
_language abstractions_ for use of _Spring Statemachine Markup Language_, in this
chapter we try to go through motivations and use cases how things can be done
in a real implementation. There's no better use case from a user perspective than to
see and learn how a framework is used in a real world.
